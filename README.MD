## Data Structures

### 1. Lists

Description and implementation of list data structure.

### 2. Linked Lists

Singly and doubly linked list implementations with examples.

### 3. Stacks

Explanation and code for the stack data structure.

### 4. Queues

Explanation and implementation of queues.

### 5. Non-Linear Data Structures

#### Trees

##### Binary Tree

A hierarchical structure where each node can have at most two children: one on the left and one on the right.

##### Binary Search Tree (BST)

A binary tree where each left node is smaller than the root node, and each right node is larger, making search, insertion, and deletion efficient.

##### AVL Tree

A balanced binary tree where the height difference between left and right subtrees doesn't exceed 1, maintaining a balanced factor.

##### Red-Black Tree

A balanced binary search tree that follows specific rules for node coloring to maintain approximate balancing.

##### B-tree

A balanced tree, especially used in file systems and databases, optimized for disk read/write operations.

#### Graphs

##### Directed and Undirected Graphs

Graphs with directed edges have edges with directions, while undirected graphs don't have defined edge directions.

##### Weighted and Unweighted Graphs

Weighted graphs have weights or values associated with edges, whereas unweighted graphs do not.

##### Cyclic and Acyclic Graphs

Cyclic graphs have at least one cycle (a closed path), while acyclic graphs do not have cycles.

## Usage

Each data structure and algorithm is provided in its own directory along with example usage, explanations, and sometimes test cases. To use any of these, simply navigate to the respective directory and explore the Python files.
